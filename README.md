# French_Museums_Python
Week 1 Day 2 - Project: Data analysis of French museums

Data from: https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/liste-des-musees-de-france-1/  
This project was done in French.

## Introduction
The language used is Python and the following libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Re (regular exressions) and Tabulate.  
To read the code, simply open the Jupyter notebook "French_Museums_Python.ipynb".

## 1. Download and read CSV file
The CSV file (liste-des-musees-de-france-2021.csv) is read in Python using Pandas.

## 2. Questions to answer
Using Python code and other modules, answer the following questions:
- How many museums are there in metropolitan France?
- In which city(ies) are there more museums?
- What is the average number of museums per city?
- What is the median number of museums per city?
- How are museums distributed by type (in percentage)?
- How many museums are there whose name begins with "Château"?
- For how many museums do we have the website address?
- Which French department has the most museums on its territory?
- Which French department has the fewest museums on its territory?
- How many museums have "Napoléon" in their name?

## 3. Additional axes of analysis
Give other sources containing additional information that can be added to the initial file:

- The "Joconde" database which contains the catalog of museum collections in France:  
https://cour-de-france.fr/actualites/liens-utiles/bases-de-donnees-publiees-sur-des-sites-tiers/article/base-joconde-catalogue-des-collections-des-musees-de-france?lang=fr  
Created in 1975, JOCONDE now provides access (at the end of March 2008) to more than 366,000 object records, 200,000 of which are illustrated with one or more images. These notices come from more than 282 different museums (assignees or custodians) which keep collections of archaeology, fine arts, decorative arts, ethnology, history or science and technology.

- The Museophile database which lists the museums of France:  
https://data.culture.gouv.fr/explore/dataset/musees-de-france-base-museofile/information/  
The Muséofile database lists the museums benefiting from the designation “musée de France” within the meaning of the Heritage Code (around 1220). It is accessible on the Open Heritage Platform. The data in this database is linked to that of the Joconde database, the collective catalog of the collections of French museums.

- The database of visits to museums in France:  
https://data.culture.gouv.fr/explore/dataset/frequentation-des-musees-de-france/information/  
Total attendance, paid and free in the Museums of France from 2001 to 2020.
